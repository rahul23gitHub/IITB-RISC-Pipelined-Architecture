# IITB-RISC-Pipelined-Architecture

ITB-RISC features a 6-stage pipelined processor, operating as a 16-bit computer with 8 general-purpose reg-
isters labeled R0 to R7, with R0 dedicated to storing the Program Counter (PC). The architecture supports
predicated instruction execution and enables multiple load and store operations. It utilizes three machine-code
instruction formats: R, I, and J types, accommodating a total of 14 instructions.
The 6 stages of the pipeline include :
1. Instruction fetch
2. Instruction decode
3. Register read
4. Execute
5. Memory access
6. Write back
